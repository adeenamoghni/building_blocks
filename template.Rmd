I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.


# Learning Assessment

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

learning_assessment= 
  tibble(
    num = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 1),
    logi = num > 1,
    abs_num = abs(num)
  )
   
ggplot(learning_assessment, aes(x=abs_num)) + geom_histogram()

median_num = median(pull(learning_assessment, num))
```
The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_num, digits = 2)`.
